Stack Overflow Chat to IRC Server
---

this tool exposes an IRC server on port 6667 for localhost.
Connect to it using your favorite IRC client and you'll be
able to access all Stack Overflow channels.

Disclaimer
---

This tool is really early stage, so it is still ugly and 
buggy, and may not work well. So be warned that you may 
get banned from SO, get pwned by the russian mafia or attacked
by a swarm of hungry trolls. I won't take any responsibility!

Build
---

to build the tool for development:

    % mkdir var
    % pip install zc.buildout
    % buildout

Use
---

once you've built it, it's easy:

    % bin/soirc_server

then open your favorite IRC client and connect to it:

    % irssi -c 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -w PASSWORD -n LOGIN

where `PASSWORD` is your stackoverflow password and `LOGIN` your stackoverflow login
(which usually is your email). It's only supporting StackExchange openid service at
the time being, though it's easy to switch to google openid.
